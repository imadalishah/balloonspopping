# Toddler Balloon Popping Game ðŸŽˆ
(Generated using Claude 3.5, Not my code, so use it accordingly)

This simple HTML-based game is designed to entertain and educate toddlers by combining fun balloon-popping with number recognition. Built with minimal resources and no external dependencies, it provides an ad-free, distraction-free experience.  

## Features  
- **Random Numbered Balloons**: Balloons display numbers (0-9) that pop when the corresponding key is pressed.  
- **Interactive Feedback**: Pops the balloon with sound and announces the number aloud.  
- **Dark Mode Design**: Protects eyes with a soothing dark theme.  
- **Keyboard Restrictions**: Only allows numeric keys (0-9) to focus on learning and interaction.  
- **Engaging Animation**: Smooth floating balloons and dynamic popping effects.  

## How to Use  
1. Download the `GameToddler.html` file.  
2. Open it in any modern web browser (no installation required).  
3. Click anywhere inside the game window to start.  
4. Use the numeric keys (0-9) to pop balloons.  

## How It Works  
- Balloons are generated with random numbers.  
- Pressing the correct key pops the balloon, increments the score, and announces the number.  
- Incorrect keys trigger a screen shake effect and prevent unintended interactions.  

## Tech Stack  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Fully standalone with no third-party libraries or dependencies.  
- **Audio and Speech Synthesis API**: Adds interactive sound effects and voice feedback.
