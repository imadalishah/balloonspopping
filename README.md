This simple HTML-based game is designed to entertain and educate toddlers by combining fun balloon-popping with number recognition. Built with minimal resources and no external dependencies, it provides an ad-free, distraction-free experience.  

## Features  
- **Random Numbered Balloons**: Balloons display numbers (0-9) that pop when the corresponding key is pressed.  
- **Interactive Feedback**: Pops the balloon with sound and announces the number aloud.  
- **Dark Mode Design**: Protects eyes with a soothing dark theme.  
- **Keyboard Restrictions**: Only allows numeric keys (0-9) to focus on learning and interaction.  
- **Engaging Animation**: Smooth floating balloons and dynamic popping effects.  

## How to Use  
1. Download the [`GameToddler.html`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imadalishah/balloonspopping/main/GameToddler.html) file directly from this repository.  
2. Open it in any modern web browser (no installation required).  
3. Click anywhere inside the game window to start.  
4. Use the numeric keys (0-9) to pop balloons.  

## How It Works  
- Balloons are generated with random numbers.  
- Pressing the correct key pops the balloon, increments the score, and announces the number.  
- Incorrect keys trigger a screen shake effect and prevent unintended interactions.  

## Tech Stack  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Fully standalone with no third-party libraries or dependencies.  
- **Audio and Speech Synthesis API**: Adds interactive sound effects and voice feedback.
